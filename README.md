# Chem4B_Special_Project
Authors: Brighton Skeel
Lab Partner: Myron Liu

Project Details: We will be evaluating the efficacy of various phase-transfer agent/organic phase combonations in selectively removing a heavy metal matrix from various water matricies (modeling the challenges of pollution reduction from water sources including sanitized water, seawater, acidified water, and 'hard' water). Project details will be added as they arise, and data, as well as an online lab notebook will be kept here.
